## Installation

### Unfolded Circle Remote

1. **Download** the latest `.tar.gz` release from the [Releases](https://github.com/JackJPowell/uc-intg-powerview/releases) page.
2. **Upload** the file via the Integrations tab in your remote’s web configurator (requires firmware >= 2.0.0).

### Docker

```sh
docker run -d \
  --name=uc-intg-powerview \
  --network host \
  -v $(pwd)/<local_directory>:/config \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  ghcr.io/jackjpowell/uc-intg-powerview:latest
```

### Docker Compose

```yaml
services:
  uc-intg-powerview:
    image: ghcr.io/jackjpowell/uc-intg-powerview:latest
    container_name: uc-intg-powerview
    network_mode: host
    volumes:
      - ./<local_directory>:/config
    environment:
      - UC_INTEGRATION_HTTP_PORT=9090   # Optional: set custom HTTP port
    restart: unless-stopped
```

## Setup & Configuration

After installation, open the integration in your remote’s web interface:

1. **Scan for Hubs:** The integration will automatically search for Hunter Douglas Powerview Smart Hubs on your network.
2. **Manual Entry:** Optionally, you can enter your hub’s IP address manually.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Hub not detected?**  
  Ensure your hub and remote are on the same network / vlan. Try manual IP entry.

- **Pairing fails?**  
  The setup process has a short timeout so make sure you are ready to press the button after pressing next. 

- **Need more help?**
